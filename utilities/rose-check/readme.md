# About ROSE Compiler

We use [ROSE compiler](http://rosecompiler.org/) to automatically transform and parallelize benchmarks, for comparison.
Performing any of these steps requires building the compiler [from source](https://github.com/rose-compiler/rose).
Build instructions are in the [Rose wiki](https://github.com/rose-compiler/rose/wiki).

After that we apply the [LoopProcessor](https://github.com/rose-compiler/rose/blob/dab37577feb8eb129c8fc15f6972222c03171c9f/tutorial/LoopProcessor.C)
tool to transform loops and [AutoPar](https://github.com/rose-compiler/rose/blob/dab37577feb8eb129c8fc15f6972222c03171c9f/projects/autoParallelization/autoPar.C)
to parallelize them. 

Note that loop and parallelization transformations are applied to the entire file[^1]. This tends to break the
structure expected by the timing utilities, and prevents benchmarking the transformed file, unless the original template
is restored. Therefore we must reverse the transformations applied to the templating code around benchmark kernel 
(the specific region of interest). As the last step we need to extract the kernel transformed by ROSE, and substitute 
it back in the original benchmark template.

The rest of this guide details the ROSE compiler operations. It includes examples to help verify the
expected behavior in each step.

### Loop Transformation

**Test program**: [dgemvT.C](https://github.com/rose-compiler/rose/blob/dab37577feb8eb129c8fc15f6972222c03171c9f/tests/roseTests/loopProcessingTests/dgemvT.C)

**Expected result**: [rose_dgemvT.C.save](https://github.com/rose-compiler/rose/blob/dab37577feb8eb129c8fc15f6972222c03171c9f/tests/roseTests/loopProcessingTests/rose_dgemvT.C.save)

**Compilation**

```
/path_to/rose/build/tutorial/loopProcessor --edg:no_warnings -w -c -fs0 -cp 0 /path_to/dgemvT.C
```

**Expected output**

```
array-copy dimension is 0
opt level=0
```

### Automatic parallelization

The auto-parallelization tool is in `rose/build/projects/autoParallelization`.
Build it using `make check`. Then it can be used to automatically parallelize programs, e.g.:

```
../autoPar --edg:no_warnings -I../headers -c /path_to/program.c
```

There is no expected output for this command.

### Transform all original benchmarks

The following command performs these steps---transformation, parallelization and template restore---on all 
original benchmarks automatically, with best effort. If it reports errors, you will need to check the output manually.

```
make rose
```

Expected output

```
3mm          transformed: âœ“   parallel: âœ“   restored: âœ“
bicg         transformed: âœ“   parallel: âœ“   restored: âœ“
colormap     transformed: âœ“   parallel: âœ“   restored: âœ“
conjgrad     transformed: âœ“   parallel: âœ“   restored: ðŸ—™
cp50         transformed: âœ“   parallel: âœ“   restored: âœ“
deriche      transformed: âœ“   parallel: âœ“   restored: âœ“
fdtd-2d      transformed: âœ“   parallel: âœ“   restored: ðŸ—™
gemm         transformed: âœ“   parallel: âœ“   restored: ðŸ—™
gesummv      transformed: âœ“   parallel: âœ“   restored: âœ“
mvt          transformed: âœ“   parallel: âœ“   restored: âœ“
remap        transformed: ðŸ—™   parallel: ðŸ—™   restored: âœ“
tblshft      transformed: âœ“   parallel: âœ“   restored: âœ“
```

The benchmarks with indicated error in last column are caused by removed `scop/endscop` pragma. 
This is not an error in transforming the file, but prevents restoring the templating code. 
It can be resolved by manually by inspecting and replacing the templating code.

Example `remap` fails to transform with following error. This is significant error and prevents measuring this example
in the alternate case. The error message is:

```
array-copy dimension is 0
Error in SymbolicValGenerator::GetSymbolicVal(): unhandled type of binary operator BOP_MOD
lt-loopProcessor: /home/rose/src/src/midend/astUtil/symbolicVal/SymbolicVal.C:344: static SymbolicVal 
  SymbolicValGenerator::GetSymbolicVal(AstInterface&, const AstNodePtr&): Assertion `false' failed.
Aborted (core dumped)
```
