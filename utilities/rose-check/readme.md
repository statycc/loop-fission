# About ROSE Compiler

We use [ROSE compiler](http://rosecompiler.org/) to automatically transform and parallelize benchmarks, for comparison.
Performing any of these steps requires building the compiler [from source](https://github.com/rose-compiler/rose).
Build instructions are in the [Rose wiki](https://github.com/rose-compiler/rose/wiki).

After that we apply the [LoopProcessor](https://github.com/rose-compiler/rose/blob/dab37577feb8eb129c8fc15f6972222c03171c9f/tutorial/LoopProcessor.C)
tool to transform loops and [AutoPar](https://github.com/rose-compiler/rose/blob/dab37577feb8eb129c8fc15f6972222c03171c9f/projects/autoParallelization/autoPar.C)
to parallelize them. 

Note that loop and parallelization transformations are applied to the entire file[^1]. 
To reverse the transformations applied to the templating code around benchmark kernel (the specific region of interest).
As the last step we need to extract the kernel transformed by ROSE, and substitute it back in the original benchmark template.

The rest of this guide details the ROSE compiler operations. It includes examples to help verify the
expected behavior in each step.

### Loop Transformation

**Test program**: [dgemvT.C](https://github.com/rose-compiler/rose/blob/dab37577feb8eb129c8fc15f6972222c03171c9f/tests/roseTests/loopProcessingTests/dgemvT.C)

**Expected result**: [rose_dgemvT.C.save](https://github.com/rose-compiler/rose/blob/dab37577feb8eb129c8fc15f6972222c03171c9f/tests/roseTests/loopProcessingTests/rose_dgemvT.C.save)

**Compilation**

```
/path_to/rose/build/tutorial/loopProcessor --edg:no_warnings -w -c -fs0 -cp 0 /path_to/dgemvT.C
```

**Expected output**

```
array-copy dimension is 0
opt level=0
```

### Automatic parallelization

The auto-parallelization tool is in `rose/build/projects/autoParallelization`.
Build it using `make check`. Then it can be used to automatically parallelize programs, e.g.:

```
../autoPar --edg:no_warnings -I../headers -c /path_to/program.c
```

There is no expected output for this command.

### Transform all original benchmarks

The following command performs these steps---transformation, parallelization and template restore---
on all original benchmarks automatically, with best effort. If it reports errors, you will need to check the output manually.

```
make rose
```

Expected output (some programs fail)

```
3mm          transformed: âœ“   parallel: âœ“   restored: âœ“
bicg         transformed: âœ“   parallel: âœ“   restored: âœ“
colormap     transformed: âœ“   parallel: âœ“   restored: âœ“
conjgrad     transformed: âœ“   parallel: âœ“   restored: ðŸ—™
...
```

15.2.2 Partial Compilation: "At present the transformation does not properly support partial compilation.
This is not a fundamental challenge to the current design, it merely reflects the incomplete state of the project.
